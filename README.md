# DigitalThermostat-Arduino
This Digital Thermostat project uses an Arduino and DHT22 sensor. Two buttons allow you to adjust the temperature, displayed on an OLED screen. The system also employs red and blue LEDs to simulate a heating coil and cooling coil, automatically activated based on room temperature. This DIY thermostat helps you maintain your desired comfort level.
