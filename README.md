# DigitalThermostat-Arduino
This Digital Thermostat project uses an Arduino and DHT22 sensor. Two buttons allow you to adjust the temperature, displayed on an OLED screen. The system also employs red and blue LEDs to simulate a heating coil and cooling coil, automatically activated based on room temperature. This DIY thermostat helps you maintain your desired comfort level.

# Components Used
    1X Arduino UNO
    1X SSD1306 OLED DISPLAY
    2X Push Button
    1X DHT22 Sensor for Temp
    1X RGB LED
    2X Relay Module
    1X Heating Coil
    1X Cooling Element/ Coil
    1X Bread Board
    Jumper Wires as required
